1880aa5a-48d8-40fb-bdc0-a092adc02ce9,Software Freedom Day,"Introduction

Every year on the third Saturday of September, hackers, free software users and open source adepts celebrate Free Software Day. For this event, HSBXL organises a day of interesting talks on the merrits, uses and principles of free and open source software, as well as adjacent topics such as privacy, open data and security. Join us for a great day of talks with a nice meal at the end and drinks and snacks throughout the day. The event is free as in freedom, so please pay your drinks, but we can flash a Linux ISO on your USB flashdrive if you’d like!
Talk Schedule

Talks will start at 13:00.
It’s about people, stupid (Stijn Vanhandsaeme)

    Prior knowledge: None needed
    Format: Presentation
    Language: English

It is always nice to develop cool projects, be idealistic and exchange geek talk, but how can we use this to help non-technical people? Stijn Vanhandsaeme presents the case of Nubo, a Belgian based cooperative offering mail and cloud, as a way to explore helping non-geek people use Free Software in their daily life. we will explore how this utimately is about building an economically stable project and how do the principles of Free Sotware correspond with the kind of economy we want to build.
From ASCII to JPEG: Hacking Image Compression (Ramiro Polla)

    Prior knowledge: None needed
    Format: Presentation
    Language: English

Ramiro will introduce us to his ascii-jpeg project, a plain-text JPEG generator that challenges our understanding of file formats. This short presentation will reveal how the project creates a single, self-describing file that is simultaneously a valid JPEG image and a readable ASCII text file. We’ll explore the clever techniques used to bridge this gap, demonstrating a creative and unexpected use of open standards and showcasing the kind of ingenuity that is at the heart of the free software movement.
Free software in robotics: build your own autonomous systems (Arne Baeyens)

    Prior knowledge: None needed
    Format: Presentation
    Language: English

Robotics software has progressed by leaps and bounds over the past years and now is an excellent time to build your own intelligent physical systems, from autonomous lawnmowers to aerial vehicles. In this talk, Arne introduces relevant robotics concepts and discusses several robotics free software projects, covering topics such as intra- and inter-robot communication, control and behavior, simulation as well as development tooling. By the end of this talk, you will have a good idea what software to use in your FOSS-based robotics projects.
Federated immersive learning, why and how (Fabien Bénétou)

    Prior knowledge: None needed
    Format: Presentation
    Language: English

We take a dive into the world of education with a talk on Federated Immersive Learning. Fabien will explore why and how open-source technologies like WebXR and ActivityPub can be used for building a decentralized, creative, and collaborative learning environment, empowering students to actively shape their own educational experiences. more information on the projects nlnet page
Why we need Digital Sovereignty and where it comes from (Sebastian Raible)

    Prior knowledge: None needed
    Format: Presentation
    Language: English

The debate surrounding technological or digital sovereignty has been ongoing for a while, but recently gained traction particularly with Trump back in office. Beyond decreasing dependencies in Europe, and investing in Open Source, one fundamental goal of digital sovereignty must be to protect fundamental rights. Sebastian’s presentation will trace the debate back to the industrial espionage that was revealed in the 2013 Snowden disclosures, data protection, and other fundamental rights in the digital age.

Sebastian is an independent political consultant and has previously worked in the European Parliament as policy advisor since 2015.
A Taste of Open Data: Exploring the Open Food Facts Project (April Bilbrey)

    Prior knowledge: None needed
    Format: Presentation
    Language: English

Join us for a talk about Open Food Facts, the world’s largest open-source food database and a recently recognized U.N. Digital Public Good. April Bilbrey, a regular volunteer and board member, will give a “show and tell” of this collaborative project, highlighting how their app empowers users to access and contribute data, including things like nutri-score , eco-score and packaging. Come learn how you can get involved with this impactful, community-driven initiative.
Panel: Looking under the white hat of professional hackers

    Prior knowledge: None needed
    Format: Panel conversation
    Language: English
    Note: This talk will not be recorded or streamed

JeGeVa, Erik and Cedric have been making a living off of ethical hacking and cybersecurity for over a decade. In this talk they will share their stories and experiences from throughout their career, and explain how Free and Open Source Software has played a role along that path. We will end the session with a round of questions. We will see what they can — and are allowed to — tell us…
Livestream

For those who can’t make it to Brussels this year, most talks will be available through a livestream on PeerTube. Of course a stream will never have the same great vibes and audience interaction as joining us live, so if you’re able to come to the hackerspace, we very much recommend it.
side activities
Food and drinks

    There is a wide range of drinks and snacks available at the space at very reasonable prices

26578fe0-9a2c-40a2-b47c-af4f124ab719,WEBINAR Building pathways to green & digital jobs for migrants,"This session is powered by the EMERALD project and is held in English  ​​

Belgium’s green and digital sectors are growing fast, but many businesses still struggle to find the right talent. In 2023, 75% of European employers reported difficulties filling skilled positions, and Belgium has the second highest job vacancy rate in the EU.

At the same time, 23% of highly-educated migrants in Belgium are working in jobs that don’t match their qualifications.

    Can migrants in Belgium bring valuable skills and untapped potential?
    How can we build effective, inclusive training pathways to help migrants access these opportunities and address labour market needs?

Join us on 26 August at 14:00 for an interactive online session to explore concrete ways of designing tailored training programmes, bringing together employers, training providers and key players in the field.

We’ll discuss challenges, opportunities, and how to collaborate for real impact.

Your experience and perspective can directly shape how these pathways are built.

The session is powered by the EMERALD project of which Beci is a partner.

Who should attend?

    Employers and HR professionals seeking workers with green and digital skills
    Training providers interested in inclusive, responsive programme design
    Organisations working with migrant communities
    Public employment services and policy actors
    Researchers and labour market specialists

Why should you not miss this session?

    Help shape a new collaborative Re-skilling Lab for Belgium​
    Contribute to real solutions for labour shortages in green and digital sectors​
    Share your insights to ensure training reflects actual needs and barriers
    Connect with others working on upskilling, inclusion, and future-proof jobs
    Get early access to the EMERALD project’s findings and pilot activities

What is EMERALD?

EMERALD is an EU-funded Erasmus+ project that addresses the growing demand for green and digital skills. 

EMERALD aims to create inclusive training pathways to upskill and reskill migrants through re-skilling labs, based on the public-private partnership models.

The project brings together 14 organisations from six countries: Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, France, Italy, and Spain. In Belgium, the partners are Synlar, Le Monde des Possibles and Beci – Chambre de Commerce de Bruxelles.

You asked, we listened...
> AI Coding Sessions @ Commons Hub Brussels are here!
Bring your idea or a project you're already working on. Our focus: using AI to tackle real-world challenges — societal, environmental, business-related, or anything else that matters — with a pragmatic, no-hype approach to implementation.

​> Who is it for?
Anyone with experience or curiosity in building AI-driven solutions. We also welcome domain experts — lawyers, researchers, entrepreneurs, etc. — looking to solve problems they encountered in their field through AI.
Whether you're mid-way through a project or starting from scratch, this is the place to explore, test, and build.

​> Format

17:00 – Kickoff
Brief intro: share what you're working on (or thinking about). We prioritise problem-solving and real-world applications. The core question: what problem do you want to solve?
17:15 – We build
Work solo or team up with others. Sessions are flexible and evolve organically around participant needs. Food and informal discussions typically follow.
The Commons Hub Brussels remains open as long as at least one member is present.
20:00 – Wrap-up
If time allows, we regroup to briefly present what we've explored or built. Everyone is invited to share the concrete steps taken toward their solution — and what comes next.

​> What to bring
A laptop, your sharpest ideas, and a willingness to learn, build, and share.

Full title :(4days!) ChatGPT & Next Generation Assistants - Training Track 
The course will aim at explaining the nuts and bolts of the new generation of chatbots such as ChatGPT, what they can be used for, and what are their limits. We will start with an overview of reference chatbots (both closed and open source, ChatGPT and Mistral for example),common use cases (writing, summarizing, brainstorming, ...), and some of the main limits of these tools (bias, hallucinations, ...). The course will then dive gradually into more advanced use cases, addressing along the way more subtle issues, both ethical and technical. Examples of ethical issues that we will address cover data privacy, intellectual property, and the digital divide. On the technical side, we will show how chatbots can be programmed and trained, using either APIs for closed-source solution, or libraries such as HuggingFace for open-source models. By the end of the course, the goal is that participants can make their informed decisions on the capabilities of this new type of software, and when and for what they may appropriately use them.
Course content

    Introduction to large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT
    Experiment with different use cases
    Discuss about limitations, both technical and ethical
    Program LLMs, both closed and open-source models (workshop day-technical profile)
    Design a Chatbot Web application (workshop day-technical profile)

Learning outcomes

    Demonstrate an understanding of large language models' technology within the field of machine learning
    Identify the primary use cases for LLMs and formulate effective prompts
    Recognize and explain the technical limitations and ethical issues associated with LLMs
    Use and program with LLMs in Python
    Apply methods for data augmentation and fine-tuning

​In the early days of a startup, building a strong team is one of the toughest challenges. Who should you hire first? How do you find the right people? And how do you build a culture that actually lasts?

​For the first public event of FirstMovers, we’ll be joined by three inspiring guests with very different backgrounds and perspectives. They've each experienced the inside-out reality of building teams in companies that have truly scaled — with all the challenges and lessons that come with it:

​Krystall Fierens-Lee, HR Advisor at Lovable (& others)

​Julie Scherpenseel, COO at Techwolf

​Antoine Coppens, Co-founder at Relu

​Expect an open and practical conversation on what it really takes to build early-stage teams — from the first hire to creating a culture that sticks.

// FR // À propos de CoderDojo

CoderDojo organise des clubs de programmation gratuites, qu’on appelle « dojo ». Lors de ces dojos, les jeunes apprennent à programmer des applications ou des jeux, à créer des sites web... Ils y rencontrent d'autres jeunes et, à la fin de chaque séance, présentent leurs projets. CoderDojo a pour objectif de rendre la programmation ludique et attractive.

Les dojos sont organisés et animés par des bénévoles. La plupart de nos coaches ont une bonne expertise en ICT. Ils peuvent ainsi orienter et assister nos petits programmeurs dans leurs projets. Nos « cooks » sont en charge de tout l’aspect pratique et organisationnel.

CoderDojo utilise principalement des logiciels open-source et gratuits. Le mouvement connaît une croissance rapide dans le monde entier.

CoderDojo veut démontrer que la programmation ce n’est pas uniquement réservée aux nerds. Nos programmeurs réalisent de chouettes projets, ils sont l’exemple parfait que la technologie peut être amusante. C’est ainsi que CoderDojo n’a qu’un mot d'ordre : « Above all : be cool ! »
Informations pratiques

Tu dois avoir entre 7 et 18 ans pour participer. Si tu as moins de 12 ans, Il est préférable que tu sois encadré par un parent. Les parents ne doivent pas être présents durant le dojo mais ils doivent rester joignables en cas de problème. Les parents sont invités à revenir une demi-heure avant la fin de l’activité afin de participer à la présentation des réalisations des participants. Ils pourront également échanger avec les bénévoles, et éventuellement leur donner un petit coup de main pour le rangement du Dojo.

Il est préférable d'apporter son ordinateur portable avec les logiciels nécessaires déjà installés. Si tu n’en as pas, précise-le au moment de l'inscription et CoderDojo t’en prêter un dans la mesure du possible.
Inscription & annulation

Le formulaire d’inscription reprend principalement les données personnelles du participant. Si l’information demandée concerne les parents ou les tuteurs cela sera spécifiquement mentionné. Au moment de l’inscription, nous demandons à tous les participants de communiquer l’email et le numéro de téléphone d’un de ses parents ou tuteurs afin que CoderDojo puisse directement les contacter en cas de problème.

En cas d'empêchment, nous demandons aux personnes inscrites de bien vouloir annuler leur réservation à temps. L'annulation peut très facilement se faire via ton compte Eventbrite. Pour cela, il suffit de te connecter, d'aller sur la page Ticket, et de chercher la réservation. Puis, en cliquant sur cette dernière, tu accèdes aux détails de ton inscription, sélectionnes ensuite « Annuler la réservation » pour annuler ton inscription. Tu recevras un email de confirmation. Si tu rencontres quelques soucis pour l'annulation, préviens-nous via bxl-yser@coderdojobelgium.be.
Parcours

La plupart des Dojos proposent différents parcours. Si tu n’as aucune connaissance, nous te conseillons de commencer par Scratch.

Respect de la vie priée

Nous aimons promouvoir nos activités à travers les réseaux sociaux et pour ce faire nous prenons des photos pendant nos événements.

Les enfants peuvent être photographiés ou filmés lors de leur participation à un dojo, mais seulement avec votre accord. Ces photos sont ensuite postées et partagées sur nos réseaux sociaux. Celles-ci ne sont pas imprimées, et ne figurent pas sur nos brochures. Si toutes fois, quelques photos devaient servir à des fins de campagnes promotionnelles plus étendues, nous vous demanderons bien sûr votre accord avant diffusion.

Si vous tenez à ce que les photos de votre enfant ou de vous-même ne soient pas utilisées, nous vous invitons à nous en faire part lors de votre inscription.

Nous respectons vos données personnelles ! Pour plus d’infos, consultez notre clause de confidentialité sur notre site web.
// NL // Over CoderDojo

CoderDojo  organiseert gratis programmeerclubs, de zogenaamde ""Dojo's"". Op die Dojo's leren meisjes en jongens programmeren, websites maken, apps en spelletjes ontwikkelen enzovoort. Ze ontmoeten gelijkgestemde deelnemers en laten elkaar zien waaraan ze gewerkt hebben. CoderDojo maakt van ontwikkelen en programmeren een superleuke, keigezellige en megatoffe leerervaring.

Dojo's worden op vrijwillige basis opgezet en gerund door vrijwilligers. Enerzijds zijn dit coaches met voldoende ICT-kennis en de juiste drive om jongeren te coachen. Anderzijds hebben we ook cooks die de praktische organisatie van de Dojo op zich nemen. CoderDojo legt sterk de nadruk op open source en vrije software. De beweging heeft een snel groeiend netwerk van leden en vrijwilligers wereldwijd.  CoderDojo wilt aan iedereen tonen dat programmeren niet enkel voor nerds is. Onze coders bouwen super leuke projecten en zijn daarom het voorbeeld bij uitstek dat technologie tof kan zijn. CoderDojo heeft daarom maar één regel: ""Above all: be cool!"".
Praktische informatie

Je kan deelnemen tussen 7 en 18 jaar. Ben je  jonger dan 12 jaar dan word je het best begeleid door (een van) je ouders. Je ouders hoeven niet de hele tijd aanwezig te zijn, maar moeten wel in de buurt blijven zodat we hen kunnen contacteren. We appreciëren het als ouders een halfuur voor het einde van de Dojo terugkeren om het toonmoment mee te maken en de vrijwilligers achteraf wat te helpen bij het opruimen.

Je dient te beschikken over een laptop. De coaches zullen ervoor zorgen dat alle benodigde software geïnstalleerd zal worden of zullen je vooraf laten weten als je iets specifieks nodig hebt. Heb je echt geen laptop, geef dit aan en dan zal CoderDojo proberen een draagbare computer te voorzien.
Registreren & annuleren

Het inschrijvingsformulier zal voornamelijk persoonlijke gegevens verzamelen over de  deelnemer. In enkele gevallen zal ook bijkomende informatie over de ouder/voogd worden gevraagd, en dat zal dan ook expliciet vermeld worden. We vragen bij de inschrijving aan alle deelnemers om een e-mailadres en telefoonnummer van de ouders of voogd op te geven. Indien nodig  zal CoderDojo  rechtstreeks contact opnemen met de ouders of voogd.

We waarderen het dat deelnemers de tijd nemen om hun bestelling actueel te houden, en als je niet aanwezig kan zijn, is het gemakkelijk om jouw inschrijving te annuleren vanuit jouw Eventbrite account. Meld je aan bij Eventbrite.com, ga naar de pagina tickets, en zoek uw bestelling. Klik op jouw bestelling om gedetailleerde informatie te bekijken, en selecteer vervolgens ""Order annuleren"" om uw inschrijving te annuleren. Je zal een e-mail ontvangen om de annulering te bevestigen. Blijkt dat niet meteen te lukken, dan kan je ons altijd contacteren via bxl-yser@coderdojobelgium.be.
Trajecten

Er zijn verschillende trajecten waaraan je kan deelnemen. Als je nog helemaal geen ervaring hebt,  start je best met Scratch.
Vragen

Contacteer ons via bxl-monty@coderdojobelgium.be! Tot snel!
Wij respecteren je privacy

CoderDojo is leuk en daarom tonen wij graag waar we mee bezig zijn. We nemen tijdens onze activiteiten foto’s van onze deelnemers en begeleiders die we daarna op sociale media plaatsen. Het kan gebeuren dat je zoon of dochter daarom gefotografeerd of gefilmd wordt tijdens een CoderDojo activiteit. Wij gebruiken dit beeldmateriaal niet op flyers of voor uitvoerige campagnes zonder hiervoor nog eens expliciet toestemming te vragen. Indien je liever wilt dat geen foto’s van je kind gebruikt worden, kan je dat tijdens het registreren aangeven.

We respecteren bovendien ook je data. Meer weten? Bekijk dan zeker even onze privacy verklaring op de website.
// EN // About CoderDojo

CoderDojo organises free coding clubs, so-called “Dojo’s”. At those Dojo’s girls and boys learn to program, make websites and develop apps and games. They meet like-minded peers and show each other their projects. CoderDojo aims on making coding a fun, cool and awesome learning experience.

Dojo’s are set-up and hosted by volunteers. Most of our coaches have an extensive ICT expertise and the drive to coach youngsters. They help our little coders with their projects. Our cooks are the helping hands behind our organisation. They are in charge of all the practical and organisational stuff. 

CoderDojo focuses on open-source and free software. The movement has a fast-growing network of members and volunteers world-wide.

CoderDojo wants to show the world that coding is not just for nerds. Our coders can build the most amazing projects and are the perfect example that technology can be fun. Therefore CoderDojo has but one rule: “Above all: be cool!”
Practical information

You should be between 7 and 18 years old to participate. Participants younger than 12 are best assisted by a parent. Parents don’t have to be present during the Dojo, but should be in the neighbourhood in case we have to contact them. We appreciate it if parents return half an hour in advance to be present for the show and tell and help our volunteers clean up after the Dojo.

You have to bring a laptop to be able to participate. The coaches will make sure all the necessary software will be installed or will let you know beforehand if you need anything specific. If you really don’t have a laptop, let us know and CoderDojo will try to provide one.
Registration & Cancellation

The registration form will primarily collect personal data about the participant. If the information asked is about parents or guardians, this will be specifically mentioned. Upon registration we ask all participants to enter an email address and phone number of a parent or guardian. If necessary, CoderDojo will directly contact the parent or guardian.

We appreciate attendees taking the time to update their order, and if you can't attend, it's easy to cancel your registration from your Eventbrite account. Just log in to Eventbrite.com, go to the tickets page, and locate your order. Click your order to view order details, and then select ""Cancel Order"" to cancel your registration. You’ll receive an email confirming the cancellation. If you have any problems cancelling a ticket, please let us know at bxl-yser@coderdojobelgium.be.
Tracks

In most Dojo's you can participate in different tracks. If you have no prior experience you can best pick Scratch.

c0342b2d-e7e7-4817-a9dc-9ab270902892,Python User Group Belgium x PyData Belgium — Community Crossover,"Details

On September 18th, we’re doing something a bit different. The Python User Group Belgium and PyData Belgium will come together for a joint meetup in Leuven.

PyData Belgium has been quiet for a while, so we thought this would be a good opportunity to bring both communities into the same room. The idea:

    We’ll run two regular talks as usual.
    Then we’ll add a third session focused on Belgium’s Python community and have a discussion on how we can best collaborate and support each other going forward.

🗓️ Agenda

You're welcome from 18:30 onwards. Food & drinks will be provided.

🍎 Session 1: Scalable LangGraph Templates: Bringing Them to Life in Reflex - by Baturay Ofluogly
In this session, we’ll explore how to build and visualize scalable LangGraph workflows by integrating them with Reflex, creating interactive and polished proof-of-concept chat applications.

🍐 Session 2: [still open!]
Interested in bringing a topic, visit the Sessionize link below!

🍊 Session 3: Strengthening Belgium’s Python Community - A Group Discussion - moderated by Murilo Kuniyoshi Suzart Cunha
An open conversation bringing together members of the Python User Group Belgium and PyData Belgium to share ideas, identify needs, and explore how we can best support and grow the country’s Python community.
📣 Call for Speakers
If you have a Python/data-related topic you’re passionate about — data science, machine learning, engineering, analytics, or anything in between — we’d love to hear from you.

👉 Submit your proposal here: https://sessionize.com/python-user-group-belgium/

Schedule details coming soon. We’re looking forward to meeting familiar faces and new ones from both communities.

c23e5bdb-642f-4a3a-ab55-45135ebcfd97,AI Bytes & Bites Webinar 8 -  complying with EU regulations?,"The webinar is held in French​​

AI Bytes & Bites Webinar 8 -  Online products and services: are you complying with EU regulations?
The GDPR is no longer the only regulation companies need to know to remain compliant in the digital space. New European legislations — the Digital Services Act, Digital Markets Act, Data Act, and AI Act — are fundamentally changing the rules for platforms, SMEs, freelancers, developers, online sellers, and digital service providers.

This webinar will give an overview of these recent regulations, their goals, and their concrete impacts. You’ll gain a clear understanding of what they mean for your website, digital services, databases, or AI tools. 

Webinar Objectives:

    Understand the key new legislations (Digital Services Act - DSA, Digital Markets Act - DMA, Data Act, AI Act)
    Identify who these regulations apply to and when they come into effect
    Assess the impact on your digital operations and AI tools
    Anticipate your obligations and reduce legal risks

Who should attend?

Ideal for entrepreneurs, software publishers, IT managers, developers, legal professionals, consultants, platform managers, freelancers, e-commerce vendors, or anyone looking to anticipate regulatory changes in the digital world.

Why not to miss the webinar?

    These European laws introduce new obligations that affect all businesses, not just big platforms
    A better understanding of these rules can help you avoid costly penalties and build trust with clients and partners.
    It’s much easier to anticipate your obligations than to deal with audits or legal disputes later on.

Speaker:

We’re bringing together theory and real-world application in two inspiring sessions:

🌀 Use Case – Agent-Based Design by Kan Design
Hans Kan (founder of Kan Design) shares how they apply multi-agent thinking in their design processes. No dry theory, but a hands-on case showing how dividing roles between agents leads to faster iteration and more creative output.

🧠 Architecture & Real-Life Agents – by Ixor CTO Davy De Waele
Ixor’s CTO will explain how Multi-Agent Systems work, how agents communicate and how you can stay in control without relying on centralised coordination. He'll also zoom in on a few real-world agents to give you a clear idea of how they operate.

This Tech Talk is ideal for:

Developers, engineers & innovation strategists interested in AI and distributed systems
Corporate team leads exploring how agent-based systems can support their workflows
SME decision-makers curious about how agents can transform the future of their organisation

Dive into the world of data-driven decision-making with our comprehensive Data Science course. Designed for professionals from diverse backgrounds this course equips you with essential skills to harness the power of data for insightful analysis and predictive modeling. 

In the first part of the course, we will provide solid theoretical bases, introducing core concepts in data science such as data types, data formats, data quality issues and predictive modeling. In order to facilitate application in practical settings, these concepts will be directly related to existing use cases under the supervision of the course lecturers. For the second part of the course, we will employ industry standard Python packages (e.g. pandas, numpy, scikit-learn), to develop a prototype of a data analysis pipeline. Participants are assumed to already have a working knowledge of programming (ideally Python), but additional self-learning resources will be provided if needed. 

Course Content 

●    Introduction to Data Science and Data Analytics

●    The four flavors of Data Analytics: Descriptive, Diagnostic, Predictive, Prescriptive

●    Implementing a data analysis pipeline with Python

●    Data Science in Practice: Do’s, Dont’s and Ethical considerations

Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course you should be able to:

●    Explain the core concepts involved in a Data Science project (i.e data types, data storage, data analysis, predictive modeling);

●    Examine an existing situation to identify what suitable Data Science methodologies and analysis are applicable

●    Develop a prototype of a data analysis pipeline using Python and its data science toolkit (pandas, seaborn, sci-kit learn, …)

À propos de cet évènement

À propos de CoderDojo

CoderDojo organise des clubs de programmation gratuits, qu’on appelle « Dojo ». Lors de ces Dojos, filles et garçons apprennent à programmer, à créer des sites web et à développer des applications et des jeux. Ils y rencontrent leurs pairs et présentent aux autres leurs projets. CoderDojo a pour objectif de rendre la programmation amusante, cool et formidable durant cette expérience d’apprentissage.

Les dojos sont mis en place et animés par des bénévoles. La plupart de nos coaches ont une grande expertise en ICT et orientent aussi les coaches plus jeunes. Ils assistent et aident nos petits programmeurs dans leurs projets.

CoderDojo se base sur des logiciels open-source et gratuits.

Informations pratiques

Tu dois avoir entre 7 et 18 ans pour y participer. Il est préférable que les participants en dessous de 12 ans soient encadrés par un parent. Les parents ne doivent pas être présents pendant le dojo mais ils doivent rester dans les alentours au cas où nous devrions les contacter.

Nous préférons que les parents reviennent un quart-d'heure avant la fin de l’activité afin qu’ils soient présents pour la démonstration des projets.


Inscription & Annulation

Le formulaire d’inscription reprend, dans un premier temps, les données personnelles du participant. Si l’information demandée concerne les parents ou les tuteurs cela sera spécifiquement mentionné. Au moment de l’inscription, nous demandons à tous les participants de communiquer l’email et le numéro de téléphone d’un de ses parents ou tuteurs afin que CoderDojo puisse directement les contacter.

Nous demandons aux personnes inscrites à une session de bien vouloir annuler leur réservation à temps en cas d’empêchement. Il est très facile d’annuler l’inscription via votre compte Eventbrite. Il suffit de se connecter à eventbrite.com, aller sur la page Ticket, et chercher la réservation. Puis en cliquant sur la réservation, tu accèdes aux détails de ton inscription, sélectionnes ensuite « Annuler la réservation » pour annuler ton enregistrement. Tu recevras un email de confirmation. Si tu rencontres quelques soucis pour annuler ton billet, préviens-nous via gembloux@coderdojobelgium.be.

ff318e50-7adb-4ac3-ba60-e23b2d4de9e9,🚀 [Moonshot Vlaanderen] Visie is niks zonder lef. Hoe krijgen we de maatschappelijke transitie op gang? ,"We staan op een kruispunt. Technologie is overal, technologie verandert alles maar wie stuurt nog? Verandert het de wereld écht ten goede — of laat het vooral bestaande systemen intact?

Op dinsdag 9 september 2025 brengen we voorlopers samen: ondernemers, beleidsmakers, privaat & publiek, burgers, hackers, academici, ontwerpers, .... 'doeners'. Allemaal mensen die niet willen wachten tot verandering hen overkomt, maar die mee willen bouwen.

We vertrekken van een droombeeld: een samenleving waarin technologie geen doel op zich is, maar een kompas dat mensen ondersteunt in hun dagelijkse leven. Bouwen aan een samenleving waarin technologie dienstbaar is aan de mens, niet andersom.

🚀

Dit is geen klassieke conferentie. Dit is een moonshot-dag: 

    We kijken samen via de 'virtuele lens' naar wat digitalisering kán zijn.
    Waarin samenwerking centraal staat in plaats van silo’s.
    Een plek waar nieuwe ideeën ontstaan die tot daden leiden.


Het is tijd voor actie - voor een nieuwe, mensgerichte digitale koers. Van maatschappelijke uitdagingen tot uitvoerbare (technologische) (AI) infrastructuur. 
 
Dan is dit jouw uitdaging. Dan is dit jouw uitnodiging.

Niet praten over transformatie, maar werken aan een gedeelde koers. We brengen voorlopers samen die willen bijdragen aan:

    Een mensgerichte, digitale samenleving.
    Digitale soevereiniteit voor burgers én overheden.
    Ecosystemisch denken als nieuwe bestuurs- en ontwikkelvorm.
    Het ontstaan van een community of practice die verder werkt na 9 september.

Keynote 1: Digitale Soevereiniteit

Björn De Vidts | CEO | Athumi

Onze digitale toekomst hangt niet alleen af van technologie, maar vooral van hoe we met data omgaan. Vandaag ligt het grootste deel van de Europese data-infrastructuur in buitenlandse handen. Dat maakt Vlaanderen en Europa kwetsbaar, maar biedt tegelijk een enorme kans: zelf de regie terugnemen.
Deze keynote laat zien hoe data-soevereiniteit de sleutel kan zijn tot digitale onafhankelijkheid. Hoe kunnen we ervoor zorgen dat burgers en bedrijven controle houden over hun eigen data? Hoe zetten we die data in voor innovatie, vertrouwen en duurzaamheid? En hoe bouwen we samen open ecosystemen die zowel economische groei als maatschappelijke vooruitgang stimuleren?
10u30 - 11u00

Keynote 2: Vlaanderen boven, kunnen we data geloven?

prof. Ruben Verborgh & PhD Raf Buyle (IDLab UGent)

Verkeersveilige wegen krijg je niet door alle voertuigen te bannen, net zoals je privacy niet oplost door alle deuren te sluiten. Burgers verwachten immers flexibele mobiliteit en vlotte dienstverlening, en dat steunt op gezonde datastromen. Daarom moeten we mensen het vertrouwen bieden dat hun data steeds voor hen werkt, zonder dat dit hun dagelijkse aandacht hoeft op te slokken. Maar bestaat er wel zoiets als digitaal vertrouwen? En kunnen we überhaupt technologie gebruiken om vertrouwen in technologie te creëren? Wij vroegen het alvast aan ChatGPT – en uiteraard ging die helemaal de mist in. Vertrouwen ontstaat immers niet automatisch; het groeit in de tijd en vraagt om transparante relaties tussen mensen, organisaties en technologie. Door systemen te ontwerpen die dat vertrouwen ondersteunen én ruimte laten voor kritische reflectie, bouwen we aan een samenleving waarin technologische vooruitgang hand in hand gaat met onze persoonlijke doelen, veiligheid én vrijheid.
11u00 - 11u30

KOFFIE pauze & eerste reflectiemoment

team Lamot

De koffiepauze is geen moment om stil te vallen, maar om te prikkelen. Dit is hét moment om ideeën met elkaar te verbinden en samen de scherpste inzichten uit de keynotes te plukken. Durf dus het gesprek aan te gaan en kijk wat er écht blijft hangen.
11u30 - 12u00

Keynote 3: De mens centraal – of niemand wint.

expert

Technologie, data en beleid hebben pas waarde als ze vertrekken vanuit de mens. Deze keynote fileert de samenleving van morgen tot haar essentie: menselijke noden, waarden en ervaringen. Geen abstracte theorie, maar ontwerpprincipes die écht werken. Want als we niet bouwen rond de mens, voor wie bouwen we dan?
12u00 - 12u30

Keynote 4: Samenwerken voorbij de comfortzone. Ecosysteem-samenwerking

expert

Echte verandering ontstaat niet binnen structuren van gisteren. Deze keynote verkent hoe ecosysteem-samenwerking – met nieuwe vormen van governance, cocreatie en gedeeld eigenaarschap – het klassieke top-down model uitdaagt. Geen solo-actie, maar gedeelde verantwoordelijkheid. Dit is geen trend, dit is een nieuwe spelregel. Durf jij los te laten?
12u30 - 13u00

Keynote 5: Kan AI de politiek redden – of maakt het alles nog erger?

Olivier Van Raemdonck | voormalig woordvoerder Jan Jambon

In een tijdperk van polarisatie, wantrouwen en complexe uitdagingen rijst een intrigerende vraag: kan artificiële intelligentie de politiek opnieuw richting geven? Olivier Van Raemdonck, voormalig woordvoerder van Jan Jambon, neemt je mee in een scherp betoog over de verantwoorde inzet van AI als bondgenoot van beleid én burger. Technologie als reddingsboei of tikkende tijdbom? Jij beslist.
13u00 - 14u00

Uitgebreide broodjeslunch en verse soep

team Lamot

Even op adem komen. Even energie tanken. Netwerken, reflectie, projectvoorstelling, inspiratiepleinen & demo's.

De lunch is geen gewoon uurtje pauze, maar een kans om losser in gesprek te gaan en nieuwe connecties te leggen. Gebruik dit uur om ideeën die spelen verder te voeden – soms ontstaan de beste inzichten gewoon aan tafel. Laat de energie van de ochtend dus niet stilvallen, maar geef ze samen een smakelijke boost.
14u00 - 15u30

Workshop. Conceptvorming. Van idee naar impact: bouwen aan digitale ecosystemen.

olv team TomorrowLab + team UGent + Martine Delannoy | EU Strateeg Digitaal Vlaanderen

In deze prototypingronde gaan we van denken naar doen. Geen praatbarak, maar handen vuil maken aan conceptvorming die ertoe doet. Samen vertalen we ideeën naar visuele voorstellen voor digitale ecosystemen die écht werken. Dit is het moment waarop eerste vage abstracte toekomstvisies tastbaar worden. Verwacht minstens 4 straffe moonshot ideeën. En in de ideale wereld - breng er zelf ook een mee ...
15u30 - 16u15

Paneldebat: Vlaanderen vooruit – of achterop?

de moderator + Bruno Segers, ex-CEO Microsoft Belgium en nu 'een geëngageerde mondige gepensioneerde'

Wat houdt ons tegen, en wat duwt ons vooruit? In dit scherpe debat buigen moderator en panelleden zich over de vraag die iedereen bezighoudt: hoe versnellen we écht? Met oa tech ondernemer Bruno Segers en een hongerige jonge wolf aan zijn zijde zoeken we naar wat Vlaanderen nodig heeft om door te breken — voorbij goede bedoelingen, recht op resultaat. Geen consensusklap, maar confrontatie met de toekomst.
16u15 - 17u00

Reflectie (& politieke respons) woorden, daden en wat daartussen zit.

de moderator + Marijke Verhavert | TomorrowLab + Yves Vanderbeken | AMS + Eddy Van der Stock | V-ICT-OR

Na een dag vol ideeën, inzichten en provocatie is het tijd voor reflectie én antwoord. Beleidsmakers reageren op de geleerde lessen en nemen positie in: wat nemen ze mee, wat durven ze beloven? Dit slotmoment is geen ceremonie, maar een uitnodiging tot engagement. De bal ligt op het (politieke) veld — wordt er gespeeld?
17u00 - 18u30

Afsluitende receptie – ideeën laten bezinken, glazen heffen.

Gouden Carolus, ...

Na een dag vol visie en vuur is het tijd om na te praten, te verbinden en te vieren. Met een Gouden Carolus in de hand blikken we samen vooruit. Want grote transities beginnen vaak met kleine gesprekken. Santé op onze moonshots. Santé op de vriendschap.
